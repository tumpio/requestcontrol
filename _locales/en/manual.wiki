== Request Control Rule ==

Request Control Rule consists of [[#pattern|Pattern]], [[#types|Types]] and [[#action|Action]].

Requests that match a pattern and types of an active rule will be intercepted taking the action of the rule.

=== Pattern ===

Pattern filters matched requests by [[#scheme|Scheme]], [[#host|Host]] and [[#path|Path]].

==== Scheme ====

Supported schemes are <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>.

{|
| <code>http</code>
| Match a http scheme.
|-
| <code>https</code>
| Match a https scheme.
|-
| <code>http/https</code>
| Match both http and https schemes.
|}

==== Host ====

Host pattern may match the host of the request URL in following ways:

{|
| <code>www.example.com</code>
| Matches a complete host.
|
|-
| <code>*.example.com</code>
| Matches the given host and any of its subdomains.
| Will match example.com and all subdomains of example.com e.g. '''www'''.example.com , '''good'''.example.com
|-
| <code>www.example.*</code>
| Matches the given host and manually listed top-level domains. (can be combined with the subdomain matching)
| Write the top-level domains to the top-level domain name list (e.g. ''com'', ''org'').
|-
| <code>*</code>
| Matches any host.
|
|}

==== Path ====

Path pattern may subsequently contain any combination of &quot;*&quot; wildcard and any of the characters that are allowed in URL path. The &quot;*&quot; wildcard matches any portion of path and it may appear more than once.

Below are examples of using path patterns.

{|
| <code>*</code>
| Matches any path.
|-
| <code>path/a/b/</code>
| Matches the exact path &quot;path/a/b/&quot;.
|-
| <code>*b*</code>
| Matches a path that contains a component &quot;b&quot; somewhere in the middle.
|-
|
| Matches an empty path.
|}

=== Types ===

Filter matched requests by the type of request. The type indicates the requested resource. All supported types are listed below.

== Extra URL Matchers ==

Following matchers extend the matching capabilities of [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest/RequestFilter WebRequest API].

=== Includes and Excludes ===

Filter matched requests by patterns that can be defined as a string with support for wildcards &quot;?&quot; and &quot;*&quot; (where &quot;?&quot; matches any single character and &quot;*&quot; matches zero or more characters), or as a regular expression pattern.

Include and exclude pattern matching is case insensitive as opposed to [[#host|Host]] and [[#path|Path]] which are case sensitive.

Below are examples of using include and exclude patterns:

{|
| <code>login</code>
| Matches URLs containing &quot;login&quot;.
|-
| <code>log?n</code>
| Matches for example URLs containing &quot;login&quot; and &quot;logon&quot;.
|-
| <code>a*b</code>
| Matches URLs where &quot;a&quot; is followed by &quot;b&quot;
|-
| <code>/[?&]a=\d+(&|$)/</code>
| Matches URLs containing parameter &quot;a&quot; with digits as value.
|}

=== Match by origin ===

Filter matched requests by origin of request.

{|
| Any
| Matches requests with any origin
|-
| Same domain
| Matches requests on same domain
|-
| Same origin
| Matches requests on same origin. Adheres to the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy Same-origin policy].
|-
| Third party domain
| Matches requests to third party domain
|-
| Third party origin
| Matches requests to third party origin
|}

== Rule priorities ==

# Whitelist rule
# Block rule
# Secure rule
# Redirect rule
# Filter rule

== Trimming URL parameters ==

Filter rule supports URL query parameter trimming. Trimmed URL parameters are defined either as literal strings with support for &quot;*&quot; and &quot;?&quot; wildcards or using regular expression.

Below are examples of using query parameter trimming patterns.

{|
| <code>utm_source</code>
| Trims any &quot;utm_source&quot; parameter
|-
| <code>utm_*</code>
| Trims any parameter starting with &quot;utm_&quot;
|-
| <code>/[0-9]+/</code>
| Trims any parameter containing only digits
|}

=== Invert Trim Option ===

Keeps only parameters that are defined in trimmed parameters list. All other parameters will be removed.

=== Trim All Option ===

Removes all URL query parameters from matched request.

== Redirect using pattern capturing ==

Redirect rule supports redirecting requests to a manually configured URL. The redirect URL may be parametrized using parameter expansion and redirect instructions. Parameter expansion allows to access and manipulate a set of named parameters of the original URL. Redirect instructions can be used to replace named parameters of original request URL (e.g. by instructing requests to redirect to a different port).

Both methods may be combined. Redirect instructions will be parsed and applied first before parameter expansions.

Parameter expansion may also be used within a redirect instruction.

=== Parameter expansion ===

<pre>{parameter}</pre>
Access a named parameter of the original request URL. Available named parameters are listed at the end of this section.

Parameter expansion supports the following string manipulation formats:

==== Substring replacing ====

<pre>{parameter/pattern/replacement}</pre>

Replaces the first matched substring in expanded parameter.

<pre>{parameter//pattern/replacement}</pre>

Replaces all occurrences of matched substring in expanded parameter.

The pattern is written in regular expression. A number of special replacement patterns are supported, including referencing of capture groups which are described below.

{|
| <code>$n</code>
| Inserts the n-th captured group counting from 1.
|-
| <code>$`</code>
| Inserts the portion of the string that precedes the matched substring.
|-
| <code>$'</code>
| Inserts the portion of the string that follows the matched substring.
|-
| <code>$&</code>
| Inserts the matched substring.
|-
| <code>$$</code>
| Inserts a &quot;$&quot;.
|}

==== Substring extraction ====

<pre>{parameter:offset:length}</pre>
Extract a part of the expanded parameter. Offset determines the starting position. It begins from 0 and can be a negative value counting from the end of the string.

==== Decoding and encoding ====

<pre>{parameter|encodingRule}</pre>
Decode or encode an expanded pattern.

{|
| <code>encodeURI</code>
| Encodes a pattern as URI. It does not encode the following characters: &quot;:&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;;&quot;, and &quot;?&quot;.
|-
| <code>decodeURI</code>
| Decodes an encoded URI.
|-
| <code>encodeURIComponent</code>
| Encodes a pattern as a component of URI. Encodes all special characters reserved for URI.
|-
| <code>decodeURIComponent</code>
| Decodes an encoded URI component.
|-
| <code>encodeBase64</code>
| Encode a pattern as Base64 string.
|-
| <code>decodeBase64</code>
| Decodes an encoded Base64 string.
|}

==== Combining manipulation rules ====

<pre>{parameter(manipulation1)|(manipulation2)...|(manipulationN)}</pre>
String manipulation rules can be chained using a &quot;|&quot; pipe character. The output is the result of manipulations chain.

==== Examples ====

<pre>https://{hostname}/new/path</pre>
Uses the hostname of the original request.

<pre>https://{hostname/([a-z]{2}).*/$1}/new/path</pre>
Captures a part of the hostname of the original request.

<pre>https://{hostname::-3|/\.co/\.com}/new/path</pre>
Uses the hostname of the original request but manipulate its length by three cutting it from the end and replace &quot;.co&quot; with &quot;.com&quot;.

<pre>{search.url|decodeURIComponent}</pre>
Captures &quot;url&quot; search parameter and decodes it.

=== Redirect instruction ===

<pre>[parameter=value]</pre>
Replace a certain part of the original request. Available named URL parameters are listed at the end of this section.

<pre>[parameter={parameter<manipulations>}]</pre>

The value of a redirect instruction can be parametrized using the parameter expansion described above.

==== Examples ====

<pre>[port=8080]</pre>
Redirects the original request to a port 8080.

<pre>[port=8080][hostname=localhost]</pre>
Redirects the original request to a port 8080 of localhost.

<pre>[port=8080][hostname=localhost][hash={pathname}]</pre>
Redirects the original request to a port 8080 of localhost where hash is the original request's path.

=== List of named parameters ===

Names of the supported parameters and their example outputs are listed in the table below.
